<font size="8">'Twas the day before Christmas, when all through the farm All the creatures were stirring, with great cause for alarm;

The stockings were barely hung by the chimney in time, As the days were too quickly approaching two-thousand and nine;

The children were hyped up on holiday treats, While only visions of bedtime left empty sheets;

Ma-ma busily wrapping in the craft room, and Art last-minute shopping at Drug Fair, Were hurrying to avoid a Christmas nightmare,

Later that day on the lawn there arose such a clatter, As the family wrestled with garland, lights and a leftover construction ladder;

The candles in the windows were placed in a jiffy, Then the tree was brought in - would it be decorated by Christmas? It was iffy.

Now Art insisted on getting into the Christmas spirit and hanging a wreath, Risking his neck and ours as we all stood in the snow beneath,

He threw down the line, then turned with a jerk, Whistling and shouting, and putting us to work;

"Now, Jakob! now, Nathan! now, Austin and Carrie! Now, Maxfield, now Ryan! Hurry up! Come on now, hurry!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now hoist away! Hoist away! Hoist away all!"

And then, in a twinkling, everything was all set, The night before Christmas was upon us as we sipped some hot chocolate,

We realized we had found true holiday spirit in working together as we looked around, And, we enjoyed some peace on earth with each other before morning, when all the children came down with a bound.

Their eyes -- how they twinkled! They were awestruck! Santa's spirit had come despite crying and pouting. What luck!

Gifts (and re-gifts) of love were torn open with the force of a bomb For some really cute pics, check out artsteinmetz.com!

Slowing down now to send our friends and family hugs and kisses, We hope you enjoyed your Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice and/or Christmas,

We hope you and yours were able to enjoy some holiday cheer, And we look forward to seeing you in a Happy New Year. </font>
