Hello and Welcome!

# Current Work

Currently, I am a private investor located in New York City and an angel investor in several startups including:

-   [Tifin](https://tifin.com/) AI for wealth management.
-   [Market Reader](https://marketreader.com) Understand markets in real time.
-   [Stronghold](https://stronghold.co) Payment and financial infrastructure for all.
-   [Launchpoint](https://launchpointeps.com/) Advanced air mobility.

Additionally, I serve on the board of the Blackrock fixed income funds and do consulting for an enterprise data science firm, Posit PBC. I occasionally publish recreational data science projects at [outsiderdata.blog](https://outsiderdata.blog). I am a member of the Economic Club of New York.

I only consider investment introductions from my established network. Unsolicited inquiries will be politely ignored.

# Earlier Work

I am the former Chairman, CEO and President of OppenheimerFunds. After joining the firm in 1986, I served as an analyst, portfolio manager and Chief Investment Officer. I was named President in 2013, CEO in 2014, and, in 2015, Chairman of the firm with \$250 billion under management. I stepped down when the firm was sold to Invesco.

I spent most of my career as a global macro fixed-income investor at OppenheimerFunds, creating several mutual funds that grew to over US\$20bn in assets. These included the multi-sector "Strategic Income Fund" and the "International Bond Fund." At various times I headed the Government, High-Yield and International Bond teams. I was nominated for Morningstar's Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2007. As CIO and CEO, I led the effort to acquire several companies to expand into energy and "smart beta" spaces.

# Philanthropy

I am passionate about advancing financial and mathematical literacy, which are essential elements of the next generation's success.

I serve on the board of ["Rock the Street, Wall Street"](https://rockthestreetwallstreet.com/) which brings financial literacy programs into high school classrooms, mostly in under-resourced communities, to encourage girls to become interested in finance. We need more diversity in finance.

I am a trustee of my Alma Mater, Denison University. Quite coincidentally, my interest in data science has grown along with Denison's. The college already had strong computer science and applied mathematics programs. A few years ago they launched a Data Analytics major and it has been one of fastest growing disciplines in the school's history. Data science skills in a liberal arts context give kids a powerful tool set that set them up well for career success. [Check it out](https://denison.edu/academics/data-analytics)!

I am a supporter and the former board chair of the National Museum of Mathematics, [MoMath.org](https://momath.org) Visit the museum when you are in NYC. We are making math cool!

Finally, I support [WFMU](https://wfmu.org/). Freeform, listener-supported, radio. Want to support the station, too?

I am grateful to have received a couple honoraria. In 2015, I was named "Man of the Year" by The [YWCA of New York City](https://ywcanyc.org/) and, in 2017, was honored to receive the "Corporate Trailblazer" award by [Black Women of Influence](https://blackwomenofinfluence.com/) for my efforts in promoting STEM education among girls and minorities.

# Education

I hold an M.B.A. in finance from Columbia Business School and a B.A. in Russian language and Slavic Studies from Denison University.

# Media

Art is one of America's least quoted pundits on financial markets. He is a frequent guest speaker at the local middle school career day and hopes to be invited to speak on matters of import by the local Kiwanis, Rotary or Odd Fellows chapter soon. Judging the by accuracy of his prognostications below, that isn't likely. None of this ancient history is relevant today but it makes an interesting time capsule for my kids.

## New York Times Dealbook Conference

I'm embarrassed about this one, but the Times posted it so I can't delete it. I thought I would look all future-y by using an iPad but it just comes off as an ill-prepared hollow sponsor spot, which it is.
